                        <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer
                            Engineering with a minor in economics, and I am expected to graduate in 2021.  I have a job
                            as an Undergraduate tutor.  In my free time I study fullstack development so that one day I will be able 
                            to create more web apps; in hopes to improve my day to day life, as well
                            as that of others.  The current tools I am learning to use are
                            React (which was used to make this website), express.js, and mongodb.</p>
